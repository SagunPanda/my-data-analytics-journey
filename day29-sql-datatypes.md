**Title: Day 29: Exploring SQL – Data Types**

 On Day 29, I explored SQL data types, which are crucial for defining the kind of data that can be stored in each column of a table. Understanding data types is essential for creating efficient and effective database schemas. Let's dive into the various SQL data types with simple explanations.

**Common SQL Data Types:**

1. **Numeric Data Types:**
   - **INT:** Used to store whole numbers.
     - **Example:** EmployeeID
   - **FLOAT:** Used to store floating-point numbers.
     - **Example:** Salary
   - **DECIMAL:** Used to store exact numeric values with a fixed decimal point.
     - **Example:** Price

2. **String Data Types:**
   - **CHAR:** Fixed-length character string.
     - **Example:** CountryCode (e.g., 'USA')
   - **VARCHAR:** Variable-length character string.
     - **Example:** LastName
   - **TEXT:** Used to store large text data.
     - **Example:** Description

3. **Date and Time Data Types:**
   - **DATE:** Used to store dates.
     - **Example:** BirthDate
   - **TIME:** Used to store time.
     - **Example:** CheckInTime
   - **DATETIME:** Used to store date and time.
     - **Example:** OrderTimestamp

4. **Binary Data Types:**
   - **BLOB:** Used to store binary data like images or files.
     - **Example:** ProfilePicture

5. **Boolean Data Type:**
   - **BOOLEAN:** Used to store true or false values.
     - **Example:** IsActive


Today's focus on SQL data types has provided me with a deeper understanding of how to define and manage the kind of data that can be stored in each column of a table. Choosing the correct data types is crucial for creating efficient and effective database schemas. As I continue this journey, I’m excited to explore more advanced SQL features and share my learnings with you.
