 On Day 4, I explored various formatting and data organization features in Excel: Conditional Formatting, Sorting, Filtering, Alignment, and Text Rotation. These tools are crucial for making data more readable and insightful.

 **Conditional Formatting:**

Conditional Formatting in Excel allows you to automatically apply formatting—such as colors, icons, or data bars—based on the values in your cells. It's a great way to highlight important data or trends. Here’s how you can use it:

* Apply Conditional Formatting:
Select the range of cells you want to format.
Go to the Home tab, click on Conditional Formatting.
Choose a rule type (e.g., Highlight Cells Rules, Top/Bottom Rules, Data Bars).
Set your criteria and format.
Example: Highlight cells greater than 100 in the range A1:A10.
Select A1:A10 > Conditional Formatting > Highlight Cells Rules > Greater Than > 100

**Sorting:**

Sorting data helps you organize it in a specific order, either ascending or descending. This is useful for ranking, ordering, or grouping your data.

* Sort Data:
Select the range or column you want to sort.
Go to the Data tab, click on Sort A to Z (ascending) or Sort Z to A (descending).
Example: Sort the data in column B from smallest to largest.
Select column B > Data tab > Sort A to Z

**Filtering:**

Filtering allows you to display only the rows that meet certain criteria. It's a powerful tool for focusing on specific data subsets.

* Apply Filter:
Select the range of cells you want to filter.
Go to the Data tab, click on Filter.
Click the dropdown arrow in the column header to set your filter criteria.
Example: Filter the data in column C to show only values greater than 50.
Select range > Data tab > Filter > Dropdown in column C > Number Filters > Greater Than > 50

**Alignment:**

Proper alignment ensures that your data is presented in a readable and organized manner. You can align text to the left, center, or right within a cell.

* Align Text:
Select the cells you want to align.
Go to the Home tab, use the alignment buttons (Align Left, Center, Align Right).
Example: Center-align text in the range D1:D10.
Select D1:D10 > Home tab > Center

**Text Rotation:**

Text rotation allows you to change the orientation of the text within a cell. This can be useful for headers or when you need to save space.

* Rotate Text:
Select the cells you want to rotate.
Go to the Home tab, click on the Orientation button.
Choose the desired rotation angle or style.
Example: Rotate text in the range E1:E5 to 45 degrees.
Select E1:E5 > Home tab > Orientation > Angle Counterclockwise
