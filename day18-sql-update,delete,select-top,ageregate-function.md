**Title: Day 18: Exploring SQL – UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT TOP, Aggregate Functions**

On Day 18, I learned about some more essential SQL commands: UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT TOP, and aggregate functions. These commands are crucial for managing and analyzing data in relational databases. Let's dive into each of these concepts with simple examples explained in text.

**UPDATE Statement:**

The `UPDATE` statement is used to modify existing records in a table.

- **Example:** Imagine you want to change the salary of an employee named John Doe to 60,000. You would use the UPDATE statement to modify John's salary in the employee database.

**DELETE Statement:**

The `DELETE` statement is used to remove records from a table.

- **Example:** If you want to remove the record of an employee named Jane Smith from the database, you would use the DELETE statement to delete Jane's record.

**SELECT TOP Statement:**

The `SELECT TOP` statement is used to retrieve a specific number of records from a table.

- **Example:** If you want to get the top 5 highest-paid employees, you would use the SELECT TOP statement to retrieve those records.

**Aggregate Functions:**

Aggregate functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value. Common aggregate functions include COUNT, AVG, SUM, MAX, and MIN.

- **COUNT:** Counts the number of rows in a set.
  - **Example:** Count the total number of employees in the company.
  
- **AVG:** Calculates the average value of a numeric column.
  - **Example:** Find the average salary of employees.
  
- **SUM:** Calculates the total sum of a numeric column.
  - **Example:** Calculate the total salary expense for the company.
  
- **MAX:** Finds the maximum value in a set.
  - **Example:** Find the highest salary in the company.
  
- **MIN:** Finds the minimum value in a set.
  - **Example:** Find the lowest salary in the company.



Today's exploration of SQL commands has been highly informative. Understanding how to use UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT TOP, and aggregate functions is crucial for effectively managing and analyzing data. As I continue this journey, I’m excited to explore more advanced SQL features and share my learnings with you.
