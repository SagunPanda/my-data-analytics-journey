**Day 33: Exploring SQL – Numeric Functions**

 On Day 33, I explored SQL numeric functions, which are essential for performing operations on numeric data. Understanding these functions is crucial for data analysis and mathematical computations in SQL. Let's dive into some commonly used SQL numeric functions with simple explanations.

**Commonly Used SQL Numeric Functions:**

1. **ABS():**
   - Returns the absolute value of a number.
   - **Example:** `SELECT ABS(-15) AS AbsoluteValue;`

2. **CEILING():**
   - Returns the smallest integer value greater than or equal to a number.
   - **Example:** `SELECT CEILING(5.7) AS CeilingValue;`

3. **FLOOR():**
   - Returns the largest integer value less than or equal to a number.
   - **Example:** `SELECT FLOOR(5.7) AS FloorValue;`

4. **ROUND():**
   - Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.
   - **Example:** `SELECT ROUND(123.4567, 2) AS RoundedValue;`

5. **POWER():**
   - Returns the value of a number raised to the power of another number.
   - **Example:** `SELECT POWER(2, 3) AS PowerValue;`

6. **SQRT():**
   - Returns the square root of a number.
   - **Example:** `SELECT SQRT(16) AS SquareRoot;`

7. **SIGN():**
   - Returns the sign of a number. 1 for positive, -1 for negative, and 0 for zero.
   - **Example:** `SELECT SIGN(-15) AS SignValue;`

8. **EXP():**
   - Returns the exponential value of a number.
   - **Example:** `SELECT EXP(1) AS ExponentialValue;`

9. **LOG():**
   - Returns the natural logarithm of a number.
   - **Example:** `SELECT LOG(10) AS LogValue;`

10. **PI():**
    - Returns the value of PI.
    - **Example:** `SELECT PI() AS PiValue;`


Today's focus on SQL numeric functions has provided me with a deeper understanding of how to perform various mathematical operations on numeric data effectively. Mastering these functions is crucial for data analysis and mathematical computations in SQL. As I continue this journey, I’m excited to explore more advanced SQL features and share my learnings with you.
