**Day 25: Exploring SQL – Creating, Dropping, and Altering Tables**

On Day 25, I focused on fundamental SQL commands for managing tables: CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE, and ALTER TABLE. These commands are essential for defining, removing, and modifying tables within a database. Let's dive into each of these concepts with simple examples explained in text.

**CREATE TABLE:**

The `CREATE TABLE` statement is used to create a new table in a database.

- **Example:** To create a table named `Employees` with columns for `EmployeeID`, `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `DepartmentID`, you would use the CREATE TABLE statement to define the structure of the table where employee data will be stored.

**DROP TABLE:**

The `DROP TABLE` statement is used to delete an existing table from a database permanently.

- **Example:** If you no longer need the `Employees` table, you would use the DROP TABLE statement to remove it and all its data from the database.

**ALTER TABLE:**

The `ALTER TABLE` statement is used to modify an existing table structure, such as adding or removing columns.

- **Example:** If you want to add a `DateOfBirth` column to the `Employees` table, you would use the ALTER TABLE statement to modify the table structure and include this new column.


Today's focus on SQL table management commands has been enlightening. Understanding how to create, drop, and alter tables is crucial for designing and maintaining databases effectively. As I continue this journey, I’m excited to explore more advanced SQL features and share my learnings with you.
