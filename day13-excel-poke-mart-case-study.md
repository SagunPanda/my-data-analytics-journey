 - Customized chart styles, colors, and labels to make the data more informative.
5. **Data Presentation:**
 - Ensured that all data was well-organized and presented in a professional manner.
 - Used merge and center, wrap text, and alignment features to improve the layout of the data.

Today's hands-on experience with the Poke Mart case study on W3Schools has been incredibly valuable. Applying Excel skills to real-world data helps in understanding the practical aspects of data analysis and management. Styling the data effectively enhances its readability and presentation, making it easier to draw insights.
