**Day 16: Diving Deeper into SQL – SELECT, SELECT DISTINCT, WHERE, and ORDER BY**

On Day 16, I delved deeper into SQL, focusing on some of its fundamental commands: SELECT, SELECT DISTINCT, WHERE, and ORDER BY. These commands are essential for querying and organizing data in relational databases. Let’s explore each of these commands and see how they are used.

**1. SELECT Statement:**

The `SELECT` statement is one of the most basic and widely used SQL commands. It is used to query and retrieve data from a database.

- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name;
  ```

- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name
  FROM employees;
  ```
  This query retrieves the first and last names of all employees from the "employees" table.

**2. SELECT DISTINCT Statement:**

The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement is used to return only distinct (different) values, eliminating duplicate records.

- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name;
  ```

- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT department
  FROM employees;
  ```
  This query retrieves the unique department names from the "employees" table.

**3. WHERE Clause:**

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter records based on specified conditions. It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a given condition.

- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition;
  ```

- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name
  FROM employees
  WHERE department = 'Sales';
  ```
  This query retrieves the first and last names of employees who work in the Sales department.

**4. ORDER BY Clause:**

The `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the result set in either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.

- **Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT column1, column2, ...
  FROM table_name
  ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC], column2 [ASC|DESC], ...;
  ```

- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT first_name, last_name
  FROM employees
  ORDER BY last_name ASC;
  ```
  This query retrieves the first and last names of all employees, sorted by last name in ascending order.

**Combining Clauses:**

These SQL commands can be combined to perform more complex queries. For example:

- **Example:**
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT department
  FROM employees
  WHERE salary > 50000
  ORDER BY department DESC;
  ```
  This query retrieves unique department names from the "employees" table where the salary is greater than 50,000, sorted in descending order.


Today's deep dive into SQL commands has provided a solid foundation for querying and organizing data efficiently. Understanding how to use SELECT, SELECT DISTINCT, WHERE, and ORDER BY is crucial for any data analyst working with relational databases. As I continue this journey, I’m excited to explore more advanced SQL features and share my learnings with you.
