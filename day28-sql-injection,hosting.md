**Day 28: Exploring SQL â€“ Injection and Hosting**

 On Day 28, I delved into two critical concepts: SQL injection and SQL hosting. Understanding these topics is essential for ensuring database security and knowing how to manage and deploy databases. Let's dive into each of these concepts with simple examples explained in text.

**SQL Injection:**

SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in an application's software by inserting malicious SQL statements into an entry field.

- **Example:** An attacker might input `'; DROP TABLE Employees; --` into a form field that directly executes SQL queries. This malicious input could delete the `Employees` table if not properly handled.

- **Prevention:** To prevent SQL injection, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements, which ensure user input is treated as data rather than executable code.

**SQL Hosting:**

SQL hosting involves deploying and managing SQL databases on a server, allowing for remote access and management.

- **Example:** To host an SQL database, you would typically use a service like Amazon RDS, Microsoft Azure SQL Database, or Google Cloud SQL. These platforms provide scalable, reliable, and managed SQL database hosting solutions.


Today's focus on SQL injection and hosting has highlighted the importance of database security and management. Understanding how to prevent SQL injection attacks is crucial for protecting data integrity, while knowing how to host and manage SQL databases is essential for ensuring accessibility and performance.
