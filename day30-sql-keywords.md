**Day 30: Exploring SQL – Keywords**

 On Day 30, I focused on SQL keywords, which are reserved words used to perform various operations in SQL. Understanding these keywords is crucial for writing effective and efficient SQL queries. Let's dive into some essential SQL keywords with simple explanations.

**Essential SQL Keywords:**

1. **SELECT:**
   - Used to select data from a database.
   - **Example:** Retrieve all records from the `Employees` table.

2. **FROM:**
   - Specifies the table to retrieve data from.
   - **Example:** Select data from the `Employees` table.

3. **WHERE:**
   - Filters records based on a specified condition.
   - **Example:** Retrieve employees where `DepartmentID` is 5.

4. **INSERT INTO:**
   - Adds new records to a table.
   - **Example:** Insert a new employee record into the `Employees` table.

5. **UPDATE:**
   - Modifies existing records in a table.
   - **Example:** Update the salary of an employee.

6. **DELETE:**
   - Removes existing records from a table.
   - **Example:** Delete an employee record where `EmployeeID` is 10.

7. **CREATE TABLE:**
   - Creates a new table in the database.
   - **Example:** Create a table named `Departments`.

8. **DROP TABLE:**
   - Deletes a table from the database.
   - **Example:** Drop the `OldDepartments` table.

9. **ALTER TABLE:**
   - Modifies the structure of an existing table.
   - **Example:** Add a new column to the `Employees` table.

10. **JOIN:**
    - Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
    - **Example:** Join `Employees` and `Departments` tables on `DepartmentID`.

11. **ORDER BY:**
    - Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.
    - **Example:** Retrieve employees ordered by `LastName`.

12. **GROUP BY:**
    - Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
    - **Example:** Group employees by `DepartmentID`.

13. **HAVING:**
    - Filters groups based on a specified condition.
    - **Example:** Retrieve departments with more than 10 employees.

14. **LIMIT:**
    - Specifies the number of records to return.
    - **Example:** Retrieve the first 5 records from the `Employees` table.

15. **DISTINCT:**
    - Selects only distinct (different) values.
    - **Example:** Retrieve distinct `DepartmentID`s from the `Employees` table.


Today's focus on SQL keywords has provided me with a deeper understanding of the essential operations and commands used in SQL. Mastering these keywords is crucial for writing effective and efficient SQL queries. As I continue this journey, I’m excited to explore more advanced SQL features and share my learnings with you.
