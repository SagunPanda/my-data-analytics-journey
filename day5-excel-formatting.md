On Day 5, I focused on enhancing my data presentation skills in Excel by learning about Text Wrapping, Charts, and Borders. These features are essential for making your data visually appealing and easy to understand. Let me share what I learned today and how you can use these features to improve your Excel skills.

**Text Wrapping:**
Text Wrapping in Excel allows you to display long text within a cell without overflowing into adjacent cells. This makes your data more readable and organized.

* Apply Text Wrapping:
Select the cells where you want to wrap the text.
Go to the Home tab.
Click on the Wrap Text button.

Example: Wrap text in cell A1.
Select A1 > Home tab > Wrap Text

**Charts:**
Charts are a powerful way to visualize data in Excel. They help you identify trends, patterns, and outliers in your data. Here’s how you can create a chart:

1.Create a Chart:
Select the range of data you want to include in the chart.
Go to the Insert tab.
Choose the type of chart you want to create (e.g., Column, Line, Pie).
Example: Create a column chart for data in the range B1:C10.
Select B1:C10 > Insert tab > Column Chart

2.Customize Your Chart:
Click on the chart to select it.
Use the Chart Tools tabs (Design and Format) to customize your chart’s appearance and settings.
Example: Add data labels to a column chart.
Select Chart > Chart Tools Design tab > Add Chart Element > Data Labels > Outside End

**Borders:**
Borders in Excel help delineate and organize your data, making it easier to read and interpret. You can add borders to individual cells or ranges of cells.

* Apply Borders:
Select the cells where you want to add borders.
Go to the Home tab.
Click on the Borders button and choose the type of border you want to apply.
Example: Add a thick outside border to range D1:F10.
Select D1:F10 > Home tab > Borders > Thick Outside Borders
